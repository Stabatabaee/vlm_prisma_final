# VLM_PRISMA — Final Project Kit

This folder is a newcomer-friendly snapshot of the **paper-critical code, configs, and outputs**.
- Start with `00_docs/HOW_TO_REPRODUCE.md`.
- Code lives in `03_src/prime/` by functional area (ingest → extract → normalize → evaluate → viz).
- Final figures/tables for the paper are under `04_artifacts`.
- Domain generalization (ophthalmology, pathology, cardiology) lives under `06_generalization`.

For full repo history, heavy caches, PDFs, and backups, see the project root (intentionally not bundled here).
